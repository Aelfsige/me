Hello, this is my first site here in the web. Please read it if you want.

<hr>
I GOT MY FIRST WEBSITE!!! This is the one of the things I have been wanting to do ever since I got into web dev. Well there is nothing in here yet, not stylish yet but hey, its a first. The reason why I seem to be overreacting is because I get to code the HTML, CSS, and JS in here AND I get to manage my blogs without the use of a database. I was actually trying to build a blog site but the solution I found required a database. I do get how it works and how to implement it, but I think its too much for a simple site. I was also weighing whether I should choose to blog using Blogger or NeoCities and neither one of them gets to have the best of both worlds: blogging and designing my site using HTML, CSS, and JS all in one. Then, I found Jekyll after a few read on [IndieWeb](https://www.indieweb.org/). Many have mentioned that they used Jekyll to create their websites (check them out if you are also curious) so I gave it a try and learned it tonight. I just finished it and you are reading this because of Jekyll and the IndieWeb. This is so cool HAHAHA. 

The site is inspired by our car's stereo system. Although not fully, the buttons and the background of the screen closely resembles it with a few modification to suit the aesthetic I'm going for. Just having fun with the design.
