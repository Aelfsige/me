<p>29 Dec 2025 - Arwin B.</p>
<p>Hello, this is my first site here in the web. Please read it if you want.</p>

<p>I GOT MY FIRST WEBSITE!!! This is the one of the things I have been wanting to do ever since I got into web dev. Well there is nothing in here yet, not stylish yet but hey, its a first. The reason why I seem to be overreacting is because I get to code the HTML, CSS, and JS in here but I get to manage my blogs without the use of a database. I was actually trying to build a blog site using NodeJS and MongoDB and the process is, of course, a bit cumbersome. I do get how it works and how to implement it, but I think its too much for a simple site. I was also weighing whether I should choose to blog using Blogger or NeoCities and neither one of them gets to have the best of both worlds: blogging and designing my site using HTML, CSS, and JS. Then, I found Jekyll after a few read on <a href="https://www.indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a>. Many have mentioned that they used Jekyll to create their websites (check them out if you are also curious) so I gave it a try and learned it tonight. I just finished it and you are reading this because of Jekyll. This is so cool HAHAHA.</p>
