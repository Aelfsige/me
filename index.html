<h1>Hi, I'm Arwin B. </h1>
<p class="about">computer science student 🖥️, car enthusiasts 🏎️, and familiar with almost all of the flags in the
    world (yes,
    its a flex) 🇵🇭</p>
<p>Feel free to explore the website 😊 Blogs is for random thoughts and family trips. Projects is for random projects
    exploring topics that I wanted to learn or expand upon (links would be available).</p>
<p>I'll make it up for the design of the site. Give me some time to be creatively inspired.😭</p>
