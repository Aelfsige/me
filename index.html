    <h1>Hi, I'm Arwin</h1>
    <p>computer science student 🖥️, car enthusiasts 🏎️, and familiar with almost all of the flags in the
        world (yes,
        its a flex) 🇵🇭.</p>
    <p>Feel free to explore the website 😊 Blogs is for random thoughts and family trips. Projects is for random
        projects
        exploring topics that I wanted to learn or expand upon (links would be available). Some of the blogs are in
        Filipino but I'll try to put an English translation next time.</p>
    <!-- <p>I'll make it up for the design of the site. Give me some time to be creatively inspired.😭</p> -->
